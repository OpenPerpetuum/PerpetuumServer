# Contributing to OpenPerpetuumServer

We generally follow a simplified gitflow model, with some coupling to other repository states, like the OPDB.

To contribute:
 - Branch from the most recent Development
 - Commit your code, push and submit a Pull Request to Development
 - Your code will be reviewed and merged unless its a pile of hot garbage

Special Notes:
The PerpetuumServer is highly coupled in some instances to DB state.  The OPDB has its own patching source control model which you should learn and follow.  If your pull request also requires database changes:
 - Submit your PR to the server, and another PR of your SQL patch to the OPDB development branch
 - **Include a comment in the PR note that the server and DB patch are interdependent**

## Code of Conduct

Your code, comments, commit messages, and everything you do on the internet will reflect on you and how others perceive you.  Act accordingly.
Trolling, harassment or abusive behaviour of any kind will not be tolerated.
This is an open source, volunteer project.  Respect people's time and privacy.


## The Team

We have a github group (fancy!) which is a subset of our full project team.
To join, hop on the discord, or find our volunteer survey, and speak with a member of the team.

Warning: we do have standards.  You will have to actually have to do something to get on the team.
